## Installation

1. **Create a Virtual Host**:
   Add the following configuration to your WampServer's virtual hosts file (usually located at `wamp/bin/apache/apache2.x.x/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`):

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName wampmono.lcl
       DocumentRoot "C:/wamp64/www/wampmono"
       <Directory "C:/wamp64/www/wampmono">
           Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
           AllowOverride All
           Require all granted
       </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

2. **Modify the `index.php` File**:
   Update the `index.php` file in your WampServer root directory (typically `C:/wamp64/www/`) with the following lines at the top:

   ```php
   // Redirects to WampMonoâ„¢, a light Manager for WampServer
   // by CRC Studio: A design & development studio
   if (!isset($_GET['wampmono']) || $_GET['wampmono'] !== 'no') {
       header("Location: http://wampmono.lcl/");
       exit;
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Apache**:
   Restart your WampServer's Apache service to apply the changes.
